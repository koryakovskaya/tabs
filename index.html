                <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is a descriptive 
                language that specifies webpage structure.
                An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. 
                Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and 
                ends with angle brackets (< >). There are a few empty or void tags that cannot enclose any text.
                You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional information 
                affecting how the browser interprets the element.

                <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a declarative language that controls how webpages 
                look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements 
                to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, 
                which determine how a webpage looks. CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, 
                along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used 
                with other markup languages like SVG or XML.

                <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally 
                developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While 
                JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, 
                a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
